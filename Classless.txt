**Class A in IP Addressing**

An IP address consists of **32 bits**, divided into different classes. Class A addresses are structured as follows:

### Structure of Class A Address:
- The first bit is fixed as 0****.
- The first **8 bits (1st octet)** represent the **Network ID**.
- The remaining **24 bits (3 octets)** represent the **Host ID**.

### Range of Class A:
- The first octet ranges from **0 to 127**.
- However, **0 and 127** are reserved and not used for network assignment.

### Example of a Class A IP Address:
