Introduction to SSL and TLS:

What is SSL?


Confidentiality Data is only accessed by client/server
Integrity
Data is not modified in between
Authentication
Encryption
Hashing
Verifying the identity of the parties who they are supposed to be.
certificates

Encryption:
What is encryption and why it’s important?
How SSL/TLS uses encryption to secure data
Types of Encryption
symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption
hybrid encryption

Hashing:
Understanding hashing and its role in SSL/TLS
Difference between encryption and hashing
Message Authentication Code (MAC) based hashing

SSL Certificates:
What are SSL certificates?
Role of Certificate Authorities (CA)
Types of SSL certificates

Public & Private Keys:
What are public and private keys?

How they work together in SSL/TLS

How SSL/TLS secures online communication
Importance of using SSL/TLS on websites


Symmetric vs Asymmetric
Symmetric:
• Faster and more efficient, suitable for large data.
•
Challenging key distribution, single key must be kept secret.
ASymmetric:
• Slower, suitable for small data.
Simplified key distribution, secure even if the public key is sharing 


Some Algo Examples
Asymmetric
• DSA
• RSA
ECC
ECDH

Symmetric
• AES
• 3DES
• RC4
