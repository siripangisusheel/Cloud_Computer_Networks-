**Virtual Cloud Network Networking Constructs**
Virtual, private network set up in Oracle data centres, with firewall rules and specific types of communication gateways
Resides in a single region
Can have up to five nonoverlapping IPv4 CIDR blocks of your choice. Allowable range is from /30 to /16.
CIDR blocks can be modified after VCNs are created.

**Subnets**
Instances are placed in subnets logically and draw their internal IP address and network configuration from their subnet.
The Virtual Network Interface Card (VNIC) determines how the instance connects with endpoints inside and outside the VCN.

**Oracle VNIC**
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure VNICS
A VNIC enables an instance to connect to a VCN and determines how the instance connects with endpoints inside and outside the VCN. Each VNIC resides in a subnet in a VCN and includes these items:
One primary private IPv4 address from the subnet in which the VNIC is, chosen by either you or Oracle.
Up to 32 optional secondary private IPv4 addresses from the same subnet in which the VNIC is, chosen by either you or Oracle.

**Security List**
A security list is a common set of firewall rules associated with a subnet and applied to instances launched inside the subnet.
Stateful means only one side traffic is considered example if we put 0.0.0.0/0 in ingress then check the stateless as no, nothing should be added to egress 
Stateless means two sides of traffic is considered example if we put 0.0.0.0/0 in ingress then check the stateless as yes even ingress the rules should be added as same 

**Network Security Group**
Network Security Group" (NSG) allows you to define security rules for a specific group of virtual network interface cards (VNICs), while a "Security List" applies security rules to all VNICs within a particular subnet
NSG can be created and attached to VNIC so that its accessible via vnic

**Route Table**
To create a Route Table:
Compute>Networking> VCN> route tables
it’s a connection between gateway and subnet 

**Internet Gateway**
Internet Gateway Is an optional virtual router you can add to your VCN to enable direct connectivity to the Internet
To create an Internet gateway: Compute>Networking>VCN>route tables>Internet gateway 
It can be only created in public subnet

**NAT Gateway**
To create an NAT gateway: Compute>Networking>VCN>route tables>route rule>NAT gateway
Instances in a private subnet don't have public IP addresses.
Add a NAT gateway to your VCN to give instances in a private subnet access to the Internet.
NAT gateways are highly available and support TCP, UDP, and ICMP ping traffic

**Local-Peering-gateway**
Local VCN peering is the process of connecting two VCNs in the same region so that their resources can communicate by using private IP addresses.
A local peering gateway (LPG) is a component on a VCN for routing traffic to a locally peered VCN.
The two VCNS in the peering relationship shouldn't have overlapping

ssh -i mypvtkey UserName@ipadderess 

**Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG)**
Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG)
DRG is a virtual router that provides a path for private traffic between your VCN and destinations other than the Internet.
Use it to establish a connection with your on-premises network via FastConnect (private, dedicated connectivity) or Site-to-Site VPN connectivity (IPSec).
DRG is a stand-alone object. You must attach a VCN to a DRG. Multiple VCNS can be attached to the same DRG. After attaching a DRG, you must add a route for the DRG in the VCN's route table to enable traffic flow.
To create a Dynamic Routing Gateway:Networking> Customer-Connectivity>Dynamic-Routing-Gateway 
To create a Dynamic Routing Gateway between Two VCN’s each one from different region VCN-1/VCN-2(Repeat the steps for both VCNS):
1: Networking> Customer-Connectivity>Dynamic Routing Gateway>Create Virtual Cloud Network Attachment> Attachment Name(give an appropriate name)>VCN(Select the Vcn-name)
2:Create Remote Peering gateway for the above:Networking> Customer-Connectivity>Dynamic Routing Gateway>Create Remote Peering Connection>Name(Give the Name)>Compartment
3:Establish the remote Peering connection:Networking> Customer-Connectivity>Dynamic Routing Gateway>Create Remote Peering Connection>Establish-Connection>Region(Choose the Region of the other VCN)>Remote peering connection OCID(Paste the OCID of the Other VCN which should be attached).
4:Create the Route Rule in VCN-1:Compute>Networking> VCN> route tables> route rule> Target Type DRG> Destination cidrblock(2nd VCN IP)> Target Dynamic Routing Gateway (Select the 2nd VCN DRG-Name)
5:Add the IP address of other vcn to security list of first VCN:Networking>VCN>VCN-1>Security-list>(Add the other VCN Ip address)

**Remote Peering Gateway (RPG)**
The two VCNS in the peering relationship must not have overlapping CIDRS. Best Practice.
Typically, RPC is for VCNs located in different regions, but it can also be used for VCNS in the same region too.
The VCNS can be located in different tenancies.

**Service Gateway**
VCNS or on-premises networks access Oracle services public IP addresses without the need to route traffic via an Internet or NAT gateway, ensuring traffic is routed over Oracle's private backbone
